/**
 * Core Application class for sites/applications using the framework.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 * Despite its name, this class doesn't actually implement an application. What it does is provide application-level
 * services and acts as a request dispatcher. An instance of the `WebApplication` class is the core of any application
 * that uses the framework to run a website. Only a single `WebApplication` instance may be created by any application.
 * Applications using the framework create an instance of (a subclass of) the `WebApplication` class, call its `exec()`
 * method and wait for it to return.
 *
 * When the `exec()` method is called it reads the received HTTP request, passes it to `handleRequest()` for dispatch,
 * and returns. `handleRequest()` asks the installed `Router` to route the request to a handler, which actions the
 * request and returns the `Response`. The response is then sent to the client and `exec()` returns. The
 * `WebApplication` instance emits some useful events along the way.
 *
 * Some useful administrative information about the running application can be set using the `setTitle()`,
 * `setVersion()` and `setMinimumPhpVersion()` methods. The title and version are made available to any other code that
 * fetches the running instance so that, for example, user messages can show the application title without having to
 * have it hard-coded.
 *
 * Applications that require a particular minimum version of PHP can set it using the `setMinimumPhpVersion()`
 * method. If this is done before `exec()` is called, the application will exit with an appropriate error message
 * when `exec()` is called if the PHP version on which the application is running is below the minimum set.
 *
 * For applications that make use of a data store, the `database()` method provides access to the `Connection`
 * responsible for the interface between the application and the data store.
 *
 * The running `WebApplication` instance can be retrieved using the `instance()` static method. This instance provides
 * access to all the services that the application provides.
 *
 * ## Plugins
 * Plugins are loaded automatically by the `exec()` method and are sourced from the `app/plugins/` subdirectory by
 * default. This can be customised in the app config file, by providing a path (relative to the application's root
 * directory) in the `plugins.path` item. Any plugin found in this directory is loaded. Plugin classes should be in the
 * `App\Plugins` namespace. This too can be customised in the app config file, by providing a valid namespace in the
 * `plugins.namespace` item. All plugins must be in the same namespace.
 *
 * Subdirectories within the plugins directory are not scanned. It is therefore sufficient to install a plugin's PHP
 * file in the plugins subdirectory for it to be loaded and enabled by the application.
 *
 * The primary use-case for plugins is to monitor for events and augment the functionality of the application while not
 * actually handling requests themselves.
 *
 * ## Requests
 * The request being handled can always be retrieved using the `request()` method. This retrieves the original HTTP
 * request that was submitted by the user agent (in other words the request `exec()` provided to `handleRequest()`).
 *
 * ## Inter-module communication
 * A simple inter-object communication mechanism is implemented by the Application class. This mechanism is based
 * on the concept of named events being emitted and objects subscribing to those events. Emitted events can
 * provide additional arguments that provide more details of the event (for example an event that fires when a
 * particular type of search has been executed might provide the search terms and result set as additional
 * arguments).
 *
 * Events are emitted by calling the `emitEvent()` method. Subscriptions to events are achieved by calling the
 * `connect()` method. Subscriptions can be unsubscribed by calling `disconnect()`. Events do not need to be
 * registered or defined before they are emitted - it is sufficient just to call `emitEvent()` in order to emit an
 * event. Any code -- plugin, class or even the main application script or `WebApplication` object -- can emit events.
 *
 * Emitters of events should take care to document the events they emit and the arguments that are provided with
 * them, and should strive to keep the signatures of their events stable (API stability) and the names of their
 * events distinct to avoid event naming clashes between different emitters.
 *
 * ## Session management
 * The `WebApplication` class can be used to manage session data in a way that all-but guarantees clashes between the
 * bead app and other applications running on the same domain are avoided. It implements a mechanism that is very simple
 * to use by hiding the complexities of keeping session data distinct behind simple, unique "context" strings. See the
 * `sessionData()` method for details of how this works.
 *
 * ### Events
 * This module emits the following events.
 *
 * - `application.pluginsloaded`
 *   Emitted when the `exec()` method has finished loading all the plugins.
 *
 * - `application.executionstarted`
 *   Emitted when `exec()` starts actual execution (just before it calls `handleRequest()`).
 *
 * - `application.handlerequest.requestreceived($request)`
 *   Emitted when `handleRequest()` receives a request to process.
 *
 *   `$request` `Request` The request that was received.
 *
 * - `application.handlerequest.routing(Request $request)`
 *   Emitted when `handleRequest()` is about to match the incoming Request to a route using the application's router.
 *
 * - `application.handlerequest.routed(Request $request)`
 *   Emitted when `handleRequest()` has successfully matched and routed the incoming `Request` to a route using the
 *   application's router.
 *
 * - `application.executionfinished`
 *   Emitted by `exec()` when `handleRequest()` returns from processing the original HTTP request.
 *
 * - `application.sendingresponse`
 *   Emitted by `exec()` when the response returned by handleRequest() is about to be sent to the client.
 *
 * - `application.responsesent`
 *   Emitted by `exec()` immediately after the response returned by handleRequest() has been sent to the client.
 *
 * ### Session Data
 * The Application class creates a session context with the identifier **application**.
 *
 * @events application.pluginsloaded application.executionstarted application.handlerequest.requestreceived
 *     application.handlerequest.routing application.handlerequest.routed
 *     application.executionfinished application.sendingresponse application.responsesent
 * @session application
 *
 * @method static self instance()
