/**
 * A sequential reader of tagged text format files.
 *
 * This class reads the content of a tagged text format files. The tagged text format is a plain-text format where
 * individual records are represented by consecutive non-empty lines of text. Each line is _tagged_ with a field
 * identifier, followed by whitespace, followed by the field content. Records are separated by one or more empty lines.
 * The _Refer_ format, used by _EndNote_, is an example of a tagged text file format.
 *
 * Tags generally take the form of a _%_ character followed by one or more alphanumeric characters. Field content
 * usually starts from the first non- whitespace character after the tag.
 *
 * In some cases, untagged lines that contain field content are permitted. These are known as _continuation lines_, and
 * they act as a continuation of the content of the field from the previous line. If supported, continuation lines may
 * not be first in a record (since there is no field to continue).
 *
 * Some tags are permitted to be present more than once per record, in which case the associated field contains either
 * an array composed of the field content from each line tagged with the field's tag, or a concatenation of that
 * content. Which is used is determined by the specific tagged format being processed.
 *
 * In ABNF, the format can be expressed as:
 *
 *     tagged-text-file: newline | newline tagged-text-file | record tagged-text-file
 *
 *     record := record-content newline
 *
 *     record-content: tag-line | record-content record-line
 *
 *     record-line := tag-line | continuation-line
 *
 *     tag-line := tag whitespace field-content newline
 *
 *     continuation-line := field-content newline
 *
 *     tag := "%" alphanumeric-char | tag alphanumeric-char
 *
 *     whitespace := " " | tab | whitespace whitespace
 *
 *     field-content := char | char field-content
 *
 *     newline := the newline character (the byte 0x0a in ASCII)
 *
 *     alphanumeric-char := "A" to "Z", "a" to "z", "1" to "9"
 *
 *     tab := the tab character (the byte 0x09 in ASCII)
 *
 *     char := any character in the file's encoding's valid range, except newline
 *
 * In most cases, a subclass implementing a parser for a specific type of tagged text file format need only reimplement
 * three methods:
 * - _applyTag()_
 * - _emptyRecord()_
 * - _validateRecord()_
 *
 * Strictly speaking, _emptyRecord()_ is not required, but it's usually a good idea to provide a record with a full
 * complement of properties in a default (empty) state to support cases where there are optional tags for records. (In
 * such cases, without a default state, returned record objects might be missing properties.)
 *
 * ## Creating readers for specific formats
 * _applyTag()_ should be reimplemented to ensure that each record parsed has its properties set correctly according to
 * the tag content read from the file. The method is called for each tag encountered for each record present in the
 * file. Thus, the calls to _applyTag()_ iteratively build toward the complete content of the record. The _applyTag()_
 * method should examine the provided tag and apply its content to the provided record in the appropriate fashion. If
 * the tag is not recognised, has invalid content, or would put the record into a state which it knows cannot possibly
 * result in a valid record, the _applyTag()_ method should set the error code and message and return _false_ to
 * indicate that the tag could not be applied. If the tag was applied, it should return _true_.
 *
 * A set of convenience helper methods is provided to aid _applyTag()_ reimplementations:
 * - _parseArrayTagContent()_ will extract an array of items from a tag's content, given the appropriate delimiter. This
 *   works much like the PHP _explode()_ built-in, except that it ensures that each item in the array is trimmed of
 *   leading and trailing whitespace.
 * - _applyRecordProperty()_ will set a record's given property to the value provided. If the record already has that
 *   property set to something non-empty, it generates an error unless the _SilentlySkipDuplicateTags_ flag is set.
 * - _appendRecordProperty()_ will update a record's given property by concatenating the value provided to the end of
 *   the property's existing value. An optional concatenating string can be provided, which will be inserted between the
 *   existing value and the provided value.
 * - _mergeRecordProperty()_ can be used like _appendRecordProperty()_ but for cases where array content needs to be
 *   merged. It expects the existing property of the record being updated to be either empty or an array, and the value
 *   to merge to be either a string that can be converted to an array using _parseArrayTagContent()_ or an array. The
 *   _KeepDuplicateListContent_ flag is honoured.
 *
 * Both _appendRecordProperty()_ and _mergeRecordProperty()_ are safe to use when the property being updated is empty.
 * They will both act like you wold expect a notional _setRecordProperty()_ to behave if the record's existing property
 * is empty.
 *
 * Finally, _validateRecord()_ can be reimplemented to validate the content of a record once it has been read in full
 * from the file, but before it is returned by _nextRecord()_. This provides subclasses with an opportunity to identify
 * errors that are not necessarily apparent while the record is being constructed (e.g. during construction a record
 * might be in a state that is invalid for a finished record but is valid for a record that has more fields to read).
 * _validateRecord()_ must return _true_ if the record is valid, _false_ if not. If it returns _false_, it _must_ set
 * the last error code, and preferably the last error message as well. The default implementation simply returns _true_,
 * effectively accepting any record as valid.
 *
 * Subclasses may define their own error codes. The class constant _ErrUser_ is provided as a starting point for
 * subclass-defined error codes. Subclasses may not use any error code that is smaller than _ErrUser_ and are encouraged
 * to define their custom error codes by referencing _ErrUser_ (e.g. `const MyCustomErrorCode = ErrUser + 1;`, etc.).
