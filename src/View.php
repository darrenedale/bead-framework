/**
 * Encapsulates a Bead view in your app.
 *
 * Views are PHP files that render page content for your application. Views are provided with data to make them reusable
 * by passing the data through the constructor or using the `with()` method. You can inject data into all views that are
 * rendered using the `inject()` method. Do this in your application constructor or `exec()` method to ensure that any
 * view rendered receives the data. Data is available using the $data array in the view file, or by using the data key
 * name as a variable (e.g. if you provide ["foo" => "bar"] as the data for a view, both `$foo` and `$data["foo"]`
 * contain the value `"bar"`). Data that is not keyed with a valid PHP variable name is not available as a separate
 * variable in the view, and can only be accessed using the `$data` array.
 *
 * All views have access to the current `WebApplication` instance in the `$app` variable, unless it's overwritten by the
 * view's data. It is recommended that you don't overwrite this variable in your views with data, but if you do you can
 * still access the `WebApplication` instance using `WebApplication::instance()`.
 *
 * ## Layouts and Sections
 *
 * ## Includes
 * Views can be included in other views by using the `include()` method in your view file. Views included in other views
 * have access to all the data from the view that includes them, plus their own data. The view's own data takes
 * precedence over data inherited from the parent view that includes it. The data in the parent is unaffected if the
 * included view has its own data that overrides it (i.e. the parent view always retains its own array of data).
 *
 * ## Components
 * You can also use views as components in other views. This is like including views except that components don't
 * inherit the data of the parent view. Components can also receive content in slots to render. Any content between
 * the `startComponent()` and `endComponent()` is the default slot, and is available as the `$slot` variable in the
 * component. You can provide more than one slot by surrounding the content with `startSlot()` and `endSlot()`. Slots
 * created like this are named, and the content is available to the component as a variable with the name of the slot.
 * Components are useful for making re-usable HTML components based on fragments of content. For example, if your app
 * has a popup that has an anchor and some content that popup up when the anchor is clicked you might have:
 *
 * popup.php:
 * ```php
 * <div class="popup">
 * <div class="popup-anchor"><?= $anchor ?></div>
 * <div class="popup-content">
 * <?= $slot ?>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * view.php:
 * ```php
 * <section>
 * ...
 * <?php View::component("popup"); ?>
 * <?php View::slot("anchor"); ?>
 * <p>Click here to show the popup</p>
 * <?php View::endSlot(); ?>
 * <p>
 * This is the content of the popup. It's all the content between component() and endComponent() that isn't a named
 * slot. You will only see this when you click the anchor.
 * </p>
 * <?php View::endComponent(); ?>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Stacks
 * Views have a concept of stacks. Stacks are named collections of content that you can add to in your views and output
 * at the appropriate point in your views/layouts. This enables views that are included in other views, used as
 * components in other views, or use other views as layouts to inject content back up the tree. The most common use case
 * is to have a stack of scripts and a stack of stylesheets which views can add to and have the top-level layout then
 * render into the &lt;head&gt; section. For example
 *
 * layout.php:
 * ```php
 * <html>
 * <head>
 * <?php View::stack("scripts"; ?>
 * </head>
 * <body>
 * <?php View::include("foo"); ?>
 * </body>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * foo.php:
 * ```php
 * <p>Some content...</p>
 * <?php View::push("scripts"); ?>
 * <script type="module" src="/js/foo-module.js"></script>
 * <?php View::endPush(); ?>
 * ```
