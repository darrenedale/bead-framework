/**
 * Class to handle translation of UI strings into alternate languages.
 *
 * Objects of this class handle translation of UI strings in an application into a target language for presentation to
 * the end user. Each created object has a target language and a set of paths in which to search for translation files.
 *
 * Translators work in conjunction with tools to extract the translatable strings from the application into a format
 * that can be easily used to create a translation for each of the strings. These translation files are then installed
 * in a location where the translator object can read them and provide the appropriate translated string when asked.
 * Translation files are named with the IETF language subtag for the language/locale (e.g. "en", "fr", "pt-BR"), with
 * the .csv suffix. IANA maintains a list of current language subtags here:
 * <http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry>
 *
 * Translatable strings are identified by their content, their source file and their line within that file. The file
 * and
 * line help to disambiguate the contexts for identical strings in case they need different translations on different
 * occasions. In all cases, if a specific translation for the file and line of a string is not found, one is sought for
 * just the file, and then for just the string. If no translation is found, the original string is returned unmodified.
 *
 * Translation files are simple CSV files. One file contains all the translations into a single language. Each row in
 * each file contains a translation of a single string in context. The first cell contains the file, the second the
 * line, the third the original string and the fourth the translated string. The file and line cells can be empty to
 * provide a "generic" translation that is not tied to a specific context.
 *
 * The _extract_translatable_strings_ tool is available to help provide the source translation files for translators to
 * work with. Given a set of paths to source files it will output the discovered translatable strings in each source
 * file in CSV format. The translator then simply adds his/her translated strings in the appropriate column using a
 * spreadsheet application. The tool always places file and line context information for every string in the generated
 * translation file. This can be removed by the translator if s/he thinks a generic translation for all contexts is
 * suitable.
 *
 * Translation files should only be generated after the source code for a release is frozen. This is because any
 * changes
 * to the source code after the translation files have been generated are likely to break the translation files due to
 * changes in the lines on which translatable strings occur. This problem can be lessened somewhat if the majority of
 * the strings in your UI can be serviced by generic translations, but it is good practice nonetheless to ensure that
 * your code is stable before having its UI translated.
 *
 * In order to use translations, an application must create an instance of the LibEquit\Translator class, provide it
 * with the language to use and one or more search paths in which to attempt to locate translation files, then use the
 * _translate()_ method with any string that it wishes to have translated. For example:
 *
 *     $t = new LibEquit\Translator('pt-BR');
 *     $t->addSearchPath('i18n/myapp/');
 *     $msg = $t->translate('Hello there %1', basename(__FILE__), __LINE__);
 *     echo str_replace('%1', $argv[1]);
 *
 * It is recommended that you use some form of placeholder system to represent content in strings that is not fixed. In
 * the above example, _%1_ is used as a placeholder to represent the content of a command-line argument. It is
 * recommended also that whatever scheme you use is capable of supporting reordering of the arguments by translators so
 * that they can be inserted into the translated string in the correct positions for the target language. Numbering
 * your
 * placeholders in sequence is a useful approach.
 *
 * This can be wrapped into small functions in your apps, using PHPs varargs and dynamic function-calling features to
 * reduce the amount of typing you need to do to translate each string. For example, with:
 *
 *     function tr( $s, $file = '', $line = '' ) {
 *        global $translator;
 *
 *        if($translator instanceof LibEquit\Translator) {
 *            $s = $translator->translate($s, basename($file), $line);
 *        }
 *
 *        // remove fixed args from array of args intended for placeholders
 *        $args = func_get_args();
 *        array_splice($args, 0, 3);
 *        $argc = count($args);
 *
 *        if(1 > $argc) {
 *            return $s;
 *        }
 *
 *        // push string onto front of arg list for call to buildString()
 *        array_unshift($args, $s);
 *        return call_user_func_array('buildString', $args);
 *     }
 *
 *     function buildString( $s ) {
 *        $args = func_get_args();
 *        array_shift($args);
 *        $argc = count($args);
 *
 *        // set up the array of placeholders: array('%1', '%2', ...)
 *        $placeholders = array();
 *
 *        for($i = 1; $i <= $argc; ++$i) {
 *            $placeholders[] = '%' . sprintf('%d', $i);
 *        }
 *
 *        return str_replace($placeholders, $args, $s);
 *     }
 *
 * translating a string becomes:
 *
 *     $translator = new LibEquit\Translator('pt-BR');
 *     $translator->addSearchPath('i18n/myapp/');
 *     echo tr('Hello there %1', __FILE__, __LINE__, $argv[1]);
 *
 * If you have no need for a separate string-building function, you could also subsume the string-building code into
 * the translation function to further reduce the code size:
 *
 *     function tr( $s, $file = '', $line = '' ) {
 *        global $translator;
 *
 *        if($translator instanceof LibEquit\Translator) {
 *            $s = $translator->translate($s, basename($file), $line);
 *        }
 *
 *        // remove fixed args from array of args intended for placeholders
 *        $args = func_get_args();
 *        array_splice($args, 0, 3);
 *        $argc = count($args);
 *
 *        if(1 > $argc) {
 *            // no args for placeholders
 *            return $s;
 *        }
 *
 *        // set up the array of placeholders to process, one for each
 *        // provided arg: array('%1', '%2', ...)
 *        $ph = array();
 *
 *        for($i = 1; $i <= $argc; ++$i) {
 *            $ph[] = '%' . sprintf('%d', $i);
 *        }
 *
 *        return str_replace($ph, $args, $s);
 *     }
